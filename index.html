<p>What about sunrise?                      <!--paragraaf 1-->
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?</p>

<p>What about killing fields?               <!--paragraaf 2-->
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?</p>

<p>Did you ever stop to notice              <!--paragraaf 3-->
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?</p>

<p>Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah                           <!--paragraaf 4-->
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

<p>What have we done to the world?          <!--paragraaf 5-->
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?</p>

<p>What about flowering fields?             <!--paragraaf 6-->
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?</p>

<p>Did you ever stop to notice              <!--paragraaf 7-->
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?</p>

<p>Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah                           <!--paragraaf 8-->
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</p>

<p>I used to dream                          <!--paragraaf 9-->
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far</p>

<p>Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah                           <!--paragraaf 10-->
